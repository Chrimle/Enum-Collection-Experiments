# Problem Statement
> Given an enum-class [`ExampleEnum`](/src/main/java/io/github/chrimle/ece/ExampleEnum.java) consisting of 100 constants,
> store 1 000 000 pseudo-random constants in an _immutable_ collection.
> 
> Experiment with the following:
> - Instantiation of the collection
> - Storing the collection
> - Check if Collection contains the given element
> - Retrieving an entry at index
> - Loop/Iterate though the collection

# Solutions
> The experiments, as solutions to the problem statement, with comparable results. 

## Experiment 1: Java's `List.of()`
